<!-- # outcome is model free
win stay lose shift -->

<!-- outcome:transition interaction is model-based effect -->

<!-- show bar plot, compute proportions separately for each task run. Avg proportions within person and then within the whole group -->

<!-- we had to prune the model for unnecessary variables to get a better fit -->
