## lme4

we had to prune the model for unnecessary variables to get a better fit

However, we still have some random effects since the point of the random effects is to add some noise that isn't independent of each other

We add random effects in order to account for non independent noise.

## Outcome

Outcome is whether you were rewarded or not.
Tendency of the reward to increase the probability of you staying

## Outcome:Transition

Does the effect of outcome change depending on whether it was a common or rare transition.
The fact it is positive means that the effect is more influential when the transition was common

## Other interpretation

Get the same outcomes as the other experiment without tiredness

## glmer tiredness model

The interaction between outcome:tiredness is negative

as you get more awake, the effect of outcome on stay decreases. Thus you get less model based and less model free.
As you get more tired the same results also occur.
